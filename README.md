# CookBookAPI
# This API was created as a final project for the Code Kentucky Program. My intention was to create an application that would serve as a personal cookbook, a simple place in my computer that would store the recipes I plan on trying throughout this year that is much elevated from the excel spreadsheet I was initially using. 
# Using SQL Server, my application stores essential data about my recipes, such as their description, category, rating out of 10, and a website link to find the instructions.
# Turning this into a CRUD API, and using Swagger to execute requests, also allowed me to make essential modifications to my data, such as modifying or deleting old entries.
#
# The 3 features from the list I included in this project are:
#    1. Make your application a CRUD API
#    2. Have 2 or more tables (entities) in your application that are related and have a function return data from both entities. (As seen with RecipeCategories)
#    3. 
#
# In order to run this project, please have Microsoft Visual Studio downloaded.
